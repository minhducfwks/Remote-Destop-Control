# Remote desktop control

A simple and efficient tool to allow remote access and control of a desktop over the network. This project enables users to interact with their remote desktop, perform administrative tasks, or troubleshoot machines from a different location.

## What is Remote Desktop Control

Remote Desktop Control is a technology that allows a user to connect to and control a computer from a distant location, typically over the internet or through a local network. This can be done from any device—such as another computer, a tablet, or even a smartphone—without needing to be physically present at the machine you're controlling.

Here’s a brief introduction to the concept and its uses:

### 1. How it works

Remote desktop control works by creating a connection between two devices: the local device (your current computer or mobile device) and the remote device (the computer you want to control). After you establish this connection, the remote device's desktop is displayed on your screen, and you can interact with it as if you were sitting in front of it.

### 2. Feature 
**Remote Access:** Control a remote desktop remotely in the same LAN.

**File Transfer:** Transfer files between the local and remote desktops and vice versa.

**Screen Sharing:** Share the remote desktop screen with the local desktop.
